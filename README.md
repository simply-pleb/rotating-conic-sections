# rotating-conic-sections
This is a simple C program I wrote because I got inspired by my Analytical Geometry course retake.

It asks you if you want to see an ellipse or a hyperbola. After you specify that, it asks you to specify the size. In the end you will see the shape rotating :D

Compile it with
> gcc main.c -lm
